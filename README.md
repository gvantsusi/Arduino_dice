An interactive Arduino project that simulates a dice roll using LEDs.  
Press a button → generate a random number (1–6) → display it via LEDs.  

## Overview
This project demonstrates how microcontrollers can be used to simulate random events. When the button is pressed, the Arduino generates a random number between **1 and 6**, and the same number of LEDs light up.  

It’s a great beginner-friendly project to learn about:
- Digital I/O with Arduino  
- Random number generation in C++  
- Controlling multiple outputs with loops  

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- 6 LEDs
- 6 Resistors (220Ω)
- 1 Push button
- Breadboard and jumper wires
